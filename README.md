# C-_MVC_Restful
Web application devolped using C# following the MVC architecture.
I have also created resful services to update/access data.
I have also restricted the access of the web application to different users based on thier roles.
Enabled socail logins.
Used AntiForgery Tokens to curb hacking attempts.
Used Typeahead package to implement autofilling in one of the forms.
